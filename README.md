### Contributing translations

All player messages are currently fully translated to English and German.

Partially translations exist for Spanish, French, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese and Russian.

When translating, you can also always test out your messages by copying them into the `messages.yml` file for SkyWars.
